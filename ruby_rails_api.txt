Ruby/Rails Online API Sources
1. www.ruby-doc.org
2. www.ruby-lang.org
3. www.rubyonrails.org
4. www.rubydoc.info
5. www.apidock.com

I prefer www.ruby-lang.org because it is a one-stop online reference relating to Ruby programming. Also, it already includes a link to wwww.ruby-doc.org and www.rubydoc.info which have comprehensive lists of English documentation sources.
